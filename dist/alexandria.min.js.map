Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  };\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

This\n * implementation is derived from LongLib in GWT.\n *\n * Constructs a 64-bit two's-complement integer, given its low and high 32-bit\n * values as *signed* integers.  See the from* functions below for more\n * convenient ways of constructing Longs.\n *\n * The internal representation of a Long is the two given signed, 32-bit values.\n * We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which\n * Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and\n * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be\n * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\n * or change in sign.\n *\n * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\n * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\n * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\n * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\n * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this\n * case would often result in infinite recursion.\n *\n * @class\n * @param {number} low  the low (signed) 32 bits of the Long.\n * @param {number} high the high (signed) 32 bits of

A validator that returns\n * a promise is called an _async validator_. Async validators run in\n * parallel, and `validate()` will wait until all async validators have settled.\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate({\n *       validator: function (value) {\n *         return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n *           resolve(false); // validation failed\n *         });\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * You might use asynchronous validators to retreive other documents from the database to validate against or to meet other I/O bound validation needs.\n *\n * Validation occurs `pre('save')` or whenever you manually execute [document#validate](#document_Document-validate).\n *\n * If validation fails during `pre('save')` and no callback was passed to receive the error, an `error` event will be emitted on your Models associated db [connection](#connection_Connection), passing the validation error object along.\n *\n *     var conn = mongoose.createConnection(..);\n *     conn.on('error', handleError);\n *\n *     var Product = conn.model('Product', yourSchema);\n *     var dvd = new Product(..);\n *     dvd.save(); // emits error on the `conn` above\n *\n * If you want to handle these errors at the Model level, add an `error`\n * listener to your Model as shown below.\n *\n *     // registering an error listener on the Model lets us handle errors more locally\n *     Product.on('error', handleError);\n *\n * @param {RegExp|Function|Object} obj validator function, or hash describing options\n * @param {Function} [obj.validator] validator function.
