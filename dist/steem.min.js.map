Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  };\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

It differs from\n * ordinary Fortuna in a few ways, though.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * Most importantly, it has an entropy estimator.  This is present because\n * there is a strong conflict here between making the generator available\n * as soon as possible, and making sure that it doesn't \"run on empty\".\n * In Fortuna, there is a saved state file, and the system is likely to have\n * time to warm up.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * Second, because users are unlikely to stay on the page for very long,\n * and to speed startup time, the number of pools increases logarithmically:\n * a new pool is created when the previous one is actually used for a reseed.\n * This gives the same asymptotic guarantees as Fortuna, but gives more\n * entropy to early reseeds.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * The entire mechanism here feels pretty klunky.  Furthermore, there are\n * several improvements that should be made, including support for\n * dedicated cryptographic functions that may be present in some browsers;\n * state files in local storage; cookies containing randomness; etc.  So\n * look for improvements in future versions.\n * </p>\n * @constructor\n */\nsjcl.prng = function(defaultParanoia) {\n  \n  /* private */\n  this._pools                   = [new sjcl.hash.sha256()];\n  this._poolEntropy             = [0];\n  this._reseedCount             = 0;\n  this._robins                  = {};\n  this._eventId                 = 0;\n  \n  this._collectorIds            = {};\n  this._collectorIdNext         = 0;\n  \n  this._strength                = 0;\n  this._poolStrength            = 0;\n  this._nextReseed              = 0;\n  this._key                     = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];\n  this._counter                 = [0,0,0,0];\n  this._cipher                  = undefined;\n  this._defaultParanoia         = defaultParanoia;\n  \n  /* event listener stuff */\n  this._collectorsStarted       = false;\n  this._callbacks               = {progress: {}, seeded: {}};\n  this._callbackI               = 0;\n  \n  /* constants */\n  this._NOT_READY               = 0;\n  this._READY                   = 1;\n  this._REQUIRES_RESEED         = 2;\n\n  this._MAX_WORDS_PER_BURST     = 65536;\n  this._PARANOIA_LEVELS         = [0,48,64,96,128,192,256,384,512,768,1024];\n  this._MILLISECONDS_PER_RESEED = 30000;\n  this._BITS_PER_RESEED         = 80;\n};\n \nsjcl.prng.prototype = {\n  /** Generate several random words, and return them in an array.\n   * A word consists of 32 bits (4 bytes)\n   * @param {Number} nwords The number of words to generate.\n   */\n  randomWords: function (nwords, paranoia) {\n    var out = [], i, readiness = this.isReady(paranoia), g;\n  \n    if (readiness === this._NOT_READY) {\n      throw new sjcl.exception.notReady(\"generator isn't seeded\");\n    } else if (readiness & this._REQUIRES_RESEED) {\n      this._reseedFromPools(!(readiness & this._READY));\n    }\n  \n    for (i=0; i<nwords; i+= 4) {\n      if ((i+1) % this._MAX_WORDS_PER_BURST === 0) {\n        this._gate();\n      }\n   \n      g = this._gen4words();\n      out.push(g[0],g[1],g[2],g[3]);\n    }\n    this._gate();\n  \n    return out.slice(0,nwords);\n  },\n  \n  setDefaultParanoia: function (paranoia, allowZeroParanoia) {\n    if (paranoia === 0 && allowZeroParanoia !== \"Setting paranoia=0 will ruin your security; use it only for testing\") {\n      throw new sjcl.exception.invalid(\"Setting paranoia=0 will ruin your security; use it only for testing\");\n    }\n\n    this._defaultParanoia = paranoia;\n  },\n  \n  /**\n   * Add entropy to the pools.\n   * @param data The entropic value.
